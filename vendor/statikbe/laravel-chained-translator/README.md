# Laravel Chained Translator

The chained translator can combine several translators that can override each others translations. Typically, at some 
point during the development phase, a content manager wants to translate or finetune the translation strings added by
developers. This often results in merge and versioning issues, when developers and content managers are working on
the translation files at the same time.  

The Chained Translator package allows translations created by developers to exist separately from translations edited by 
the content manager in separate `lang` directories. The library merges the translations of both language directories, 
where the translations of the content manager (the custom translations) override those of the developer (the default 
translations).

For instance, the default translations created by developers are written in the default Laravel `lang` directory in
`resources/lang`, and the translations by the content manager are added to `resources/lang-custom`. When a translation 
key exists in the `resources/lang-custom` directory, this is preferred, otherwise we fallback to the default 
translations. 

We offer two package that provide a UI to let content managers edit translations.
- [Laravel Nova Chained Translation Manager](https://github.com/statikbe/laravel-nova-chained-translation-manager) for Laravel Nova
- [Laravel Filament Chained Translation Manager](https://github.com/statikbe/laravel-filament-chained-translation-manager) for Laravel Filament

## Installation

Via composer:
```
composer require statikbe/laravel-chained-translator
```

## Commands

### Merge the custom translations back into the default translation files
If you want to combine the translation files made in the current environment by the content manager with the default 
translation files, you can use the following command. You need to pass the locale as a parameter, since this library is
agnostic of the locales supported by your Laravel application. Laravel sadly does not have a default supported locales 
list. So if you want to merge all files for all supported locales, run this command for each locale.

For example, for French: 

```shell script
php artisan chainedtranslator:merge fr
``` 

This command can be useful to merge the translation work of a translator back into the default translation files. 

## Configuration

You can publish the configuration by running this command:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Statikbe\LaravelChainedTranslator\TranslationServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

### The following configuration fields are available:

#### 1. Custom lang directory
By default, the custom translations are saved in `resources/lang-custom`. This can be configured using `custom_lang_directory_name`.

#### 2. .gitignore in custom lang directory
If `add_gitignore_to_custom_lang_directory` is set to true, a .gitignore file is added to the custom 
language directory.

#### 3. Group keys in nested arrays
If `group_keys_in_array` is set to true, dotted translation keys will be mapped into arrays.

Set to __true__: saved as nested arrays, f.e.
```php
'key' => [
   'detail' => 'translation',
]
```

Set to __false__: saved as dotted keys, f.e.

```php
'key.detail' => 'translation',
```

#### 4. Custom json group name
You can edit the group name of all json translations with the `json_group`.
 
## TODO's & Ideas

- option to overwrite the default `lang` directory. This could be useful on local and staging environments to manage the
developer translations.
